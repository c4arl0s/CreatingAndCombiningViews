This tutorial guides you through building Landmarks - an app for discovering and sharing the places you love. You will start by building the view that shows a landmark's details. 

To lay out the views, Landmarks uses stacks to combine and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you will include a standard MapKit component. As you refine the view's design, Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code.
